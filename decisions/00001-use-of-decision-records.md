# 1. Record data science decisions

Date: 2022-06-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the decisions made during the analyses.

## Decision

We will use an adaptation of Software Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), for data science.

## Consequences

üëç Everyone who looks at this repository will be able to see the key decisions that were made during the analysis in one place.

üëç It should be easier to explain why decisions were made.
