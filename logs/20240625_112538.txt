INFO:root:Received prompt: Determine 3 potential drug targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
INFO:root:Iteration: 1
INFO:root:Generated thought-action: 1. **Chain of Thought**:
    - **Understanding the Task**: The goal is to identify three potential drug targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus using a biomedical database. This involves querying the database to find genes associated with the disease that could be potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
    - **Evaluating Progress**: No queries have been executed yet, so there are no results to summarize at this point.
    - **Identifying Obstacles**: The main challenge is to effectively use the database schema to extract meaningful information about gene-disease associations, gene expression, and potential drug targets related to type 2 diabetes. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy of the disease name matching in the database queries is crucial.
    - **Considering Options**: Possible next steps include:
        - Using fuzzy matching to ensure that the disease name "type 2 diabetes mellitus" is correctly identified in the database.
        - Querying the database to find genes that have a known genetic association with type 2 diabetes, are differentially expressed in the disease, or are reported in literature.
        - Prioritizing genes based on their scores in genetic association, differential expression, and literature evidence.
    - **Choosing the Next Action**: The best next action is to perform a Neo4j query to find genes associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, focusing on those with high scores in genetic association, differential expression, and literature evidence. This approach will help identify the most promising drug targets.

3. **Action Inputs**:
    - **<cypher>**:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (g:Gene)-[r:Has_Genetic_Association_With|Is_Differentially_Expressed_In|Is_Reported_In_Literature_For]->(d:Disease)
    WHERE d.name =~ '(?i).*type 2 diabetes mellitus.*'
    RETURN g.name AS GeneName, 
           COLLECT(DISTINCT type(r)) AS Relationships, 
           SUM(r.score) AS TotalScore
    ORDER BY TotalScore DESC
