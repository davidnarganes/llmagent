INFO:root:Received prompt: Determine 3 potential drug targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
INFO:root:Iteration: 1
INFO:root:Generated thought-action: # Chain of Thought
1. Understanding the Task: The task is to identify three potential drug targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus using a biomedical database. This involves querying a database schema that includes various nodes and relationships related to genes, diseases, pathways, and compounds.
2. Evaluating Progress: Since this is the beginning of the task, no progress has been made yet in terms of querying or identifying potential targets.
3. Identifying Obstacles: The main challenge is to effectively utilize the database schema to extract relevant information about genes and their associations with type 2 diabetes. The complexity of the schema and the relationships might pose a challenge in formulating the right queries.
4. Considering Options: The options include performing exact match queries to find direct associations between genes and the disease, using fuzzy search to account for variations in naming or terminology, and potentially using an internet search to verify or supplement database findings.
5. Choosing the Next Action: The best next step is to start with a simple query to identify genes directly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus using the 'genetic_association' relationship in the database. This will provide a baseline of potential targets to explore further.
